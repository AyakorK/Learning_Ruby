# Learning_Ruby

My second mission into OpenSourcePolitics was to create a script, with the base of the one I did on shell to learn ruby that will add a confirmation when we are removing a folder that contains a .important file

# How to use it
Install it
Launch the program on an IDE
If you want to make a confirmation your folder MUST contain a file named .important don't forget it otherwise it will erase it without any confirmation
Make sure to put in parameter the good route to your file 
Safe your important programs while deleting it
